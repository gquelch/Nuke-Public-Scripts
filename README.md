## ReloadAllReads

This script will simply reload all Read nodes in your Nuke file

## gradeConvert

Sometimes I find myself working on a grade node, and deciding I want to use Saturation, or adjust specifically the mids. Instead of creating an additional colour correct, you can copy over gamma and gain to a colour correct, and keep working.

**Please note this will not work with Black point and White point, only Gamma, Gain and Lift**

## openReadPath

This will open up a file browser at the file path for any read nodes you have selected
